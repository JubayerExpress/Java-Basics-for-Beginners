## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these Java programs, you'll need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

### Running the Programs

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-basics-for-beginners.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
    ```bash
    cd java-basics-for-beginners
    ```
3. Compile and run the Java files using the following commands:
    ```bash
    javac src/HelloWorld.java
    java -cp src HelloWorld
    ```

### Learning Goals

By working through these examples, you will:
- Understand basic syntax and structure of Java programs.
- Learn how to declare variables and use different data types.
- Gain knowledge of control flow structures (if-else, loops).
- Work with arrays and methods.
- Understand object-oriented programming principles (classes, objects, inheritance).
- Learn how to handle exceptions.
